# miniRT

## Overview
miniRT is an introductory ray tracer project designed to teach the fundamentals of ray tracing and computer-generated imagery (CGI). This project provides hands-on experience in implementing mathematical concepts to create visually appealing graphics.

### Contributors
- **Obrittne** - Main Developer
- **Qdo** - Helper

## Key Features
- Utilizes the **miniLibX** library for graphics handling.
- Supports basic geometric objects: **spheres**, **planes**, and **cylinders**.
- Implements essential lighting models, including **ambient** and **diffuse** lighting.
- Allows transformations such as **translation** and **rotation** for objects, lights, and cameras.
- Processes scene descriptions from a `.rt` file format.

## Functionality
- Renders scenes based on specific angles and positions defined by geometric shapes and lighting configurations.
- Ensures responsive window management with clean exit options.
- Handles object intersections and correct rendering based on light sources.

## Bonus Enhancements
Potential extensions include:
- Specular reflection for a full Phong reflection model.
- Support for multiple light sources.
- Additional geometric shapes (e.g., cones, hyperboloids).
- Texture handling with bump mapping.

## Goals
- Develop foundational knowledge in ray tracing.
- Gain confidence in implementing complex mathematical formulas.
- Create visually impressive images to demonstrate understanding.

Feel free to explore the project and experiment with different scenes and enhancements!
